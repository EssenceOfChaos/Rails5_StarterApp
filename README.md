# Rails 5 Starter Application
## Created by Frederick John

### **This is a common starting point for my applications. It contains the following...**

* **Two Models: User & Task**
*models include associations (i.e. foreign key for bidirectional relationship)*

* **Two Controllers, one for each model**
*controllers include CRUD actions (i.e. methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting objects)*

* **Views**
*Along with the standard views provided by scaffolding I've added encrypted passwords and image uploads for new users*

* **Gems**
*Semantic-ui for styling, font-awesome for icons, paperclip for image uploads*

* **Sass**
*I've chagned application.css to an .scss extension and imported external stylesheets for improved stylesheet management*
